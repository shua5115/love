Tasks to do
- Assimp
    - (done) Finish conversion functions
        - (done) For every love Object allocation, be sure to reduce the reference count by 1 after pushing onto the stack.
    - (done) File importing function
    - Test with other files assimp can load, since testing on one file is not enough
- Math library
    - Vectors (not a custom type, just a metatable and a bunch of metamethods)
    - Quaternions, same deal as vectors
    - 3D transforms which use vectors and quaternions to store transformations
    - Modify existing transform class to have 3D transformations
- Imgui
    - Leave this for later...
